### What I learned

This project was a challenge for me. It took me a while to figure out how to place the profile photo on top of the card header and body. Using a negative margin worked well in the end. I also struggled placing two background images in the appropriate place. I started by using pixel values until I realized I needed to use VH VW so the background can grow and shrink properly with the viewport. I attached that bit of CSS below!

```css
body {
  background-image: url("/images/bg-pattern-top.svg"),
    url("/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");
  background-position: right 50vw bottom 40vh, left 50vw top 50vh;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forwared to keep refining my basic CSS skills and flexbox. I'm about to start learning CSS Grid.
